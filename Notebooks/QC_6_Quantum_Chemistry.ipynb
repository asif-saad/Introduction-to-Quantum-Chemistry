    "Quantum chemistry is a discipline of chemistry that studies how quantum mechanics can be applied to chemical systems. Quantum chemistry is an amazingly useful approach for understanding molecular characteristics and reactions. The rapid advancement of computer technology (especially the advent of quantum computation) has motivated scientists to apply quantum chemistry to better comprehend, simulate, and forecast molecular characteristics and reactions, nanoscale material properties, and biological reactions and processes.\n",

    "Quantum chemistry is concerned with understanding electronic structure and molecular dynamics using the Schrödinger equations. One of the most important themes in quantum chemistry has been the development of computational quantum chemistry methods capable of tackling big or complex systems."

    "Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961; Nobel Prize in Physics, 1933), an Austrian physicist, created wave mechanics in 1926, a mathematical concept that describes the relationship between the motion of a particle with wavelike features (such as an electron) and its permissible energies. Schrödinger devised quantum mechanics in the process, which is still used to describe the energy and position of electrons in atoms and molecules today.\n",

    "Schrödinger's Equation is a linear partial differential equation which depicts the three-dimensional behaviour of an electron in an atom. The electron's position, mass, total energy (potential energy + kinetic energy) are all defined by this mathematical equation. The Schrödinger Equation in its most basic version is as follows: $$ \\hat{H}\\psi = E\\psi $$ where $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, E is the energy of the electron, and $\\psi$ is the wavefunction."

    "An **operator** acts as a set of instructions that define what to do with a function that follows it. A **Hamiltonian operator** is a three-dimensional function that represents the total energy (sum of the kinetic and potential energies) of the particles in a system (example an electron and a nucleus in an atom). For a one-electron system, the Hamiltonian operator is given by: $$ \\hat{H} = \\frac{-h^2}{8\\pi^2m_e} \\left(\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta x^2}+\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta y^2}+\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta z^2}\\right) - \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0r}$$ where h is the Planck's constant, $m_e$ is the mass of electron, e is the charge of electron, r is the distance from the nucleus ($r^2=x^2+y^2+z^2$), Z is the charge of nucleus, and $4\\pi\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of vacuum."
