When the orbitals of two shared electrons overlap in front of each other, a sigma bond is formed. When two parallel orbitals overlap, they form a pi bond. The bonding atomic orbitals frequently take on the characteristics of multiple different types of orbitals. **Hybridization** is the technique used for obtaining an atomic orbital with the correct character for bonding in molecules.\n",

This procedure helps in calculating accurate energies without including any ionic structures, and is complementary to many accurate and efficient computer programs.
