    "Through VQE, we can simulate the resultant/product yield energy of a reaction of two or more elements/molecules. If we have a high-energy molecule reacting with another molecule we expect the end product to yield a lower energy state, and only if the end product yields a lower energy state then the reaction takes place, this can be simulated using VQE.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Quantum computers because every time we add a particle or molecule to the system the computational cost grows exponentially. Add this why we use quantum computers, as every time we add qubit to the system our computational spaces doubles.\n",

    "We can estimate the ground state energy of a system, by its wave function, which represents the molecule. We then vary our wave function until we get a minimum value of the ground state energy, given our model of the Hamiltonian. A Hamiltonian is just a mathematical description of the total energy of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple use case of the VQE is to compute the interatomic distance of elements of a molecule. So, we can change the interatomic distance and use the VQE to compute the lowest energy at each distance. Then the distance that gives the lowest energy, yields the actual interatomic distance.\n",
