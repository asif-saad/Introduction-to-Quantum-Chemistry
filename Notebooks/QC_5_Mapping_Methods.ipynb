    "Each term <i>$P_j$</i> in the Hamiltonian is typicaly referred to as a <b>Pauli string</b> and the number of non-identity single-qubit Pauli operators in a given string is called its <b>Pauli weight</b>.\n",

    "The primary advantage of the JW encoding is its simplicity.However, while the occupation of a spin-orbital is stored locally, the parity is stored non-locally. The string of Z operators means that a fermionic operator mapped to qubits generally has a weight of O(M) Pauli operators, each acting on a different qubit."
