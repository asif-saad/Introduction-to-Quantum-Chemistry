In this journey we are going to explore an essential goal and an important application of Quantum Computation that is to simulate the quantum systems using information which is quantum mechanical in nature (Richard Feyman 1982). Before going on to develop a quantum algorithm dealing with the Schrodinger Equation we will first explore the idea behind Quantum Phase Estimation in Quantum Information Science. </b></i>\n",

    "In Quantum Computing, phase estimation is a quantum algorithm that can be used to estimate the eigen values of a Unitary Operator and by using this application of QPE, we can develop efficient quantum algorithms to tackle the most complex problems in Quantum Chemistry. Quantum Phase estimation algorithm was initially proposed by Alexei Yurievich Kitaev, a Russian–American professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology and permanent member of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics.\n",

    "\n",
    "Often in many mathematical or physical problems we need to transform the problem from the original space (in which the problem lies and it's solution is more difficult) to a another space for which we can find out the solution more easily. Hence we indirectly find out the solution of the original problem and for the actual solution of the problem we just need to perform the reverse operation to get back to the original space. This strategy is more clearly depicted in the following diagram presented below.\n",
